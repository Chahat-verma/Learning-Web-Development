About
This repository is your one-stop resource for learning web development from scratch. It includes structured topics, recommended tutorials (both written and video), helpful cheat sheets, and a track of practice projects to build confidence and skills as you go.

Learning Path
1. HTML & CSS
Understand semantic HTML tags, forms, tables, and layout elements.

Learn CSS basics—selectors, box model, positioning, flexbox, and grid.

Try challenges: build a landing page, style a portfolio site.

Build something as simple as a blog homepage or profile card—practice is key

.

2. JavaScript
Learn core concepts: variables, functions, arrays, objects, and DOM manipulation.

Practice event handling, API calls (fetch), and asynchronous logic.

Build mini projects: image slider, to‑do list, weather app.

3. Version Control (Git & GitHub)
Learn branching, commits, pull requests, and GitHub Pages for hosting demos.

4. Frontend Frameworks
Explore at least one modern framework/library: React, Vue or Angular.

Build a small dynamic project (e.g. a movie browser or recipe finder).

5. Backend Fundamentals
Get familiar with Node.js + Express or a comparable backend stack.

Hands-on with building RESTful APIs, connecting to databases, and simple auth.

Optional deep dives: Python (Flask/Django), PHP, or others.

📦 Project Portfolio
Here you’ll include links and descriptions for your completed projects. Example:

Project Name – one-sentence summary
e.g., "A to‑do list app using localStorage and vanilla JS."

As you progress, update this section with demos, live links, GitHub repos, and screenshots.
